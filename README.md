Sorry to recruiter, I didn't get time to polish this small app much. It took me only 4 hours to setup and develop. 
Not suer if this test only wants a desktop version app. But because my recent focus is web application.
I have been working on desktop app years ago, but picking it up will take longer time. So I did this web app version.
